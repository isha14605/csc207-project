To get started with the program you will need to go to "Visual Interface" and run the program. You will be given
two options:

1.Log In
2.Create Account

When creating an account you will be prompted to input your name, email and password. You will also have to choose the
type of User you wish to be.

We have 4 user types: Attendee, Speakers, Organizers, and VIPs. However, VIPs can only be created by a Organizer.
Each has their own hub of what they can interact with.

For everything to be run and set up, Organizers will need to create rooms, events, and conferences before anything else
can be done. In addition, an Attendee won't be able to sign up for an event unless speakers (if applicable) are booked.

A panel can have a maximum of 5 speakers that need to be scheduled together before an attendee can sign up.

For an Event to be scheduled to a Room, the Room needs to have the tech requirement that the Event needs to operate.
Rooms that are out of the event's time range or do not meet the tech requirement will not be offered to the organizer as
suitable options of the event to be held in.

A conference can only have 1 event at a time.

Note: On some devices, the Create Account button may take a bit of time to be presented to the screen.
