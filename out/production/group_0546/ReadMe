To get started with the program you will need to go to "visual Interface" and run the program. You will be given
two options:

1.Log In
2.Create Account

When creating an account you will be prompted to input your name, email and password. You will also have to choose the
type of User you wish to be.

We have 4 user types being attendee, speakers, organizers, vips. However, Vips can only be created by a Organizer User
Each has their own hub of what they can interact with.

For everything to be run and set up organizers will need to create rooms, events and conferences what can be added to
each other. An attendee won't be able to sign up for an event unless speakers(if applicable) are booked.

A panel can have a maximum of 5 speakers that need to scheduled together before an attendee can sign up.

For a event to be scheduled to a room the rooms needs to have the tech requirement that that event needs to operate.
Rooms that are out of events time range or doesn't meet the tech requirement will not be offered to the organizer as
suitable options of the event to be held in.

A conference can only have 1 event at a time
